# Tic Tac Toe Chat Program in Python 3

A very simple chat program developed in Python 3 where users can play a text game of Tic Tac Toe using Python sockets.<br />
When invoking the game a random person is chosen to go first.<br />

To run:<br />
python3 chat_server.py -- Make sure to run this first <br />
python3 chat_client.py

Note: If running on one computer, I'd suggest the py files in a different shell.
